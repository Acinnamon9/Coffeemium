Good choice. “Rustic artisan aesthetic” gives you room to express origin, craft, and warmth — perfect for Indian single origins and blends.
Before we jump in: these prompts are tuned for **Midjourney / DALL·E / SDXL** style syntax — descriptive, layered, and consistent.
They all share the same backbone for style consistency:

> **Base style template:**
> `A rustic artisan coffee product scene, warm natural lighting, wooden surface, burlap textures, scattered roasted beans, subtle steam, vintage tone, handcrafted packaging, detailed realism, product photography aesthetic, shallow depth of field.`

Each product will get a **unique modifier** that ties its name + description to the visual.

You’ll feed these to your generator in batch with consistent parameters (same seed / style preset / aspect ratio like 1:1 or 4:5).

Want me to refine them into prompt syntax optimized for a specific generator (like Midjourney, SDXL, or DALL·E 3)? The wording precision matters a lot for stylistic cohesion.
